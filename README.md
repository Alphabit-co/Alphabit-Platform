# Alphabit.co Platform Overview

Founded December 2017

Alphabit.co is a decentralized cryptocurrency social media community. The internet is being sensored all around us and big organizations control what people see and don't see in the form of not only advertisements but also complicated algorithms. Aphabit.co aims to change the censorship and control of the internet. Alphabit believes that the creators of content and those viewing the content deserve to be rewarded in the form of Aphabit (LPH) for what they provide to the community. There is no middle man or meditary control over the alphabit.co community. It is completely based on voting. Please review the blackpaper that has been created.

The primary goal is to give users tokens for interacting and providing their attention the the Alphabit (LPH) platform. Users will earn LPH for interacting with the platform & their positive behavior. Including but not limited to the following: 

- Creating an Account
- Posting an Update
- Uploading a Profile Photo
- Adding Friends
- Posting in Forms
- Joining Groups
- Viewing Pages / Content
- Positive Behavior
- Plus a whole bunch more

Likewise you will also be charged for interacting with the platform as well. Users can sell their content, articles, videos, music, and even tangible items as well for LPH as development continues. For those that receive spam / inappropriate content reports this user will lose alphabit (LPH) for his/her negative behavior. This removal of tokens is 100% driven by the community to keep alphabit safe. Consistent disregard of the community and showing spam or negative comments this user will be voted for removal / banning by the entire community. (votes weighted by Alphabit (LPH) holdings). Other ways users can spend / lose tokens:

- Leaving Groups
- Deleting Comments / Content
- Negative Behavior / Spam

Alphabit (LPH) is still in the early development stages and a lot can change during the setup and beta testing phases. One thing will remain. The total supply of LPH will not be more than 50,000,000. You can view a live beta version of Alphabit.co on our website. Signup for an account and earn 1 LPH right away. Any funds or holdings will be applied to your account once the platform has officially launched in 2018/2019.
